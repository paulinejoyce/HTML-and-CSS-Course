			<h1><em>IRON MAN</em></h1>
			<img src="https://terrigen-cdn-dev.marvel.com/content/prod/1x/_tony_card_1.jpg">
			<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.superherostuff.com/biographies/ironmanbiography.html">Iron Man, like knights of old, is identified by the armor he wears. The best-dressed of the Marvel heroes, he has changed his look frequently since his debut in 1963, but he can afford to: the man who wears the suits (and designs them) is wealthy inventor Tony Stark. So the man make the clothes, but do the clothes make the man?

			Not only does Tony Stark have no super powers of his own, but the armor that gives him strength was also created to keep his damaged heart beating; he could not survive without his iron shell. Eventually his cardiac condition was corrected by a heart transplant, and a later that left him paralyzed was repaired with a microchip. So even without his high-tech costume Tony Stark is a mixture of man and machine, what science fiction writers call a cyborg.

			Exactly who Stark might be without his armor is difficult to say. Writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck initially presented him as a suave playboy, part of a long tradition of rich men who have become masked heroes. Yet unlike most of his predecessors, Stark got his income from a specific source: he manufactured and sold weapons. This was a slightly sinister occupation, despite its undoubted utility, and there were hints that Stark was ambivalent about his role. When his business was menaced by a hostile takeover in a 1979 storyline, he collapsed into alcoholism, and a friend was obliged to take over temporarily the job of Iron Man. So the suit an function without Stark, but can Stark function without the suit?

			Stark publicly proclaims that Iron Man is his bodyguard, and to avoid prosecution for his own violence he once announced that the man in the suit had died and been replaced. He might have been talking about himself, since he is empowered by machinery and sustained by another man's heart. Beneath his polished veneer, Iron Man may be the most troubled of Marvel's heroes, forever fighting to prove that his armor is not hollow.</blockquote>

			<h1><em>CAPTAIN AMERICA</em></h1>

			<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.superherostuff.com/biographies/captainamericabiography.html">Marvel's biggest success during The Golden Age, and one of the top-selling super heroes of all time, Captain America is, first and foremost, a manifestation of patriotism. His debut preceded his county's entry into World War II, and he rode the wave of public spirit that followed Pearl Harbor; thus he identified himself forever with a period that may have been The Golden Age of the United States as much as it was The Golden Age of comic books. Sentimentally, a certain nostalgia for the period remains, even among those who are too young to have experienced its triumphs and tragedies firsthand.
			
			When the war ended, Captain America seemed to lose his purpose. Within a few years he was retired, and a short lived revival in the 1950s seemed to confirm fears that he had become irrelevant. His successful return in the 1960s however, ingeniously took advantage of the problem: Captain America was portrayed as a relic of a less complicated era awakened like Rip Van Winkle. Know his quest for identity and direction are the themes of his adventures; he seeks the meaning of freedom in a time where patriotism may not be quite the same thing as unquestioning loyalty to political leaders.

			Of course Cap has always been wrapped in the American flag, yet he is best symbolized by the shield he carries. Creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby originally designed it to be triangular, but soon after made it round instead. It represents both defense and a target, and when thrown like a discus, it also functions as a surprisingly effective weapon. A safeguard that draws fire and then fights back, the shield is the perfect emblem for Captain America.</blockquote>
