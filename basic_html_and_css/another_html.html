			<h1>Sonnet 116</h1>
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 6 px">
				Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
				Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
				Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
				Or bends with the remover to remove.<br>
				O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>
				That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
				It is the star to every wand'ring bark,<br>
				Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
				Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
				Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br>
				Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
				But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
				If this be error and upon me prov'd,<br>
				I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.<br>
			--William Shakespeare &copy;</span></p>
